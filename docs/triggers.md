# Triggers

## What are the triggers

In simple terms, a trigger is what contains the logic for the [scheduler](./schedulers.md) to
execute. Internal jobs contain their own trigger which checks when a job should be the next to run.

There are five types of triggers available within the Asyncz.

- [Triggers](#triggers)
