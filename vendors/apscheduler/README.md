# APScheduler

Although Asyncz is not Apscheduler there is no deny that the base was and although completely
rewritten in Pydantic and with a different structure and use cases, we believe it is worth
mention APScheduler and the main reason is simply because it wouldn't be possible to have Asyncz
without APScheduler and we used the same level of testing as the library to make sure we were
covering the needed use cases but not all of them as Asyncz has a different target.

## Attribution

Asyncz is mainly the APScheduler rewritten with Pydantic and with some changes to be compliant
with some of the new use cases covered by Asyncz and therefore the attribution goes to APScheduler.
